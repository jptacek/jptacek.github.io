        <p><strong>Update:</strong> That did not last long... Apparently Microsoft will soon enable the ability to log in via aliases (from <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2013/04/17/outlook-com-gets-two-step-verification-sign-in-by-alias-and-new-international-domains.aspx">Outlook.com</a> blog). Hopefully this will be an optional feature.</p>
<p>I have had my Microsoft account migrated from the old Hotmail to the new Outlook.com look for a while now. In general, the new Outlook.com has a MUCH better user interface than the old Hotmail.</p>
<p>I have also been migrating away from my Gmail account to a different email provider. I have been using Gmail for a LONG time, since 2004. However, some recent privacy snafus on Google&#39;s part and the abandonment of Google Reader inspired me to migrate over. So I have decided to give Outlook.com a try (and don&#39;t worry, I have no illusions about Microsoft and my privacy either<span style="font-family:Wingdings">J</span>)</p>
<p>Now that I am paying more attention to Outlook I have run across a feature I wasn&#39;t previously aware of, and it is awesome. What feature is that? Outlook.com email aliases.</p>
<p>First, a quick overview of how I use email. I have personal email, hosted on a Google apps domain. This is what I use for emailing with family and friends. Not being a huge spam fan, I then use my Google Gmail address for all things &quot;Internet&quot;. So for sites like Facebook, LinkedIn or Netflix I sign up using my Gmail address.</p>
<p>The one problem with this is there are some sites I trust with my email address more than others. I know some sites are going to spam me than others and are more likely to &quot;share&quot; my email address. For example, once Tickemaster gets your email, everyone has your email. Some sites you visit require you to have an email address to access content, and you have no idea what you are getting yourself into. With Gmail, I have used the + trick, which allows you to create a disposable email address that will automatically come to your account. For example, if your email address is <a href="mailto:me@gmail.com">me@gmail.com</a>, you can use your address name and a plus(+) sign, <a href="mailto:me+SpamingNewsletter@gmail.com">me+SpamingNewsletter@gmail.com</a> and email will go to your original address. I usually end up forgetting these over time. The other thing is, you are not fooling anyone. Even if you use <a href="mailto:me+SpammingNewsletter@gmail.com">me+SpammingNewsletter@gmail.com</a>, people know your email address is <a href="mailto:me@gmail.com">me@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>So this is where Outlook.com email alias feature comes in, and it&#39;s awesome. </p>
<p>First, to create an alias, go to the Gear icon and choose Mail Settings. From there, under account, choose Create an Outlook alias.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/outlook-com-email-aliases/041813_1008_OutlookComE1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can choose to create an address from any of Microsoft&#39;s current email domains; Live, Hotmail and Outlook.</p>
<p>Type in your new email alias and then you are given the option to create a new folder where all of your email gets moved when it is sent to the alias or you can send it to your inbox</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/outlook-com-email-aliases/041813_1008_OutlookComE2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now you have a new email address associated with your default outlook.com account. </p>
<p>Here is what I find so great about this. </p>
<p>First, you can create multiple aliases, up to five a year, associated with your account. Personally, I have created two separate outlook.com aliases. One, I use for the Internet I trust. For example, my Facebook, Netflix, Linked accounts, etc. They all have been, or are in the process of getting migrated to an Outlook alias. I have a second alias, for the Internet I don&#39;t trust. These are things like Ticketmaster, or mailing lists. Essentially, anyone I am afraid of sending me spam. I can then log into my default outlook.com account, and see emails to both of those aliases and they are in folders.</p>
<p>The second thing that I like about the outlook aliases is that you cannot log in with them. So, let&#39;s say LinkedIn gets hacked and my email address is in the hand of a bored script kiddie in the Ukraine. They will not be able to access my account at all because the alias is just for email and NOT account access.</p>
<p>It appears email aliases have been around for a long while in Outlook/Hotmail, I was just never aware of them. They are a great tool in helping clean up your accounts on the internet, and they add an extra level of security in case one of the sites you access gets hacked and your account is one of them. Check them out!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> That did not last long... Apparently Microsoft will soon enable the ability to log in via aliases (from <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2013/04/17/outlook-com-gets-two-step-verification-sign-in-by-alias-and-new-international-domains.aspx">Outlook.com</a> blog). Hopefully this will be an optional feature.</p>

        <div class="post-date">Mar 28th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>My daughter was recently asking me what classes she should take for next year, one of the options was Creative Writing. I told her the choice was easy, Creative Writing, &quot;You can never be too good of a writer&quot;. Similarly for the Internet, you can never be too secure.</p>
<p>There are LOTS of horror stories out about people who have had their lives severely impacted by people getting access to their account information. Last year, Matt Honan <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/">wrote</a> a cautionary tale about how easily someone was able to take over his digital life for Wired. It is well worth reading. If that one was not enough, then you can read another account from James Fallows <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/hacked/308673/?single_page=true">wrote</a> for the Atlantic.</p>
<p>First off, you should be doing basic things. Do NOT use the same password for all sites. DO NOT have passwords that exist in the dictionary. DO have special characters, numbers and mixed case in your passwords. That is just plain, Internet common sense though.</p>
<p>The reality though is, your password is only so good. What everyone should do is setup two factor authentication. Two factor authentication is really &quot;something you know&quot; (your password) and &quot;something you have&quot;, an object like a phone. For enterprise users, this is old hat. The vast majority of large companies require users to have a SecurID card to get access to their network. The card generates a token that changes on a regular internal (60 seconds for example) that user needs to enter when logging in.</p>
<p>However, in the consumer space, this has been much slower in coming. Several years ago Google introduced two factor authentication. Facebook also has the ability for you to enable a variation of two factor authentication. If the browser is not recognized as one you have used before, it will send a SMS to your phone. Twitter is in the process of enabling two factor authentication after 250,000 user accounts were compromised. Microsoft has SOME variation of it. It will occasionally prompt you with a verification code when making account changes or accessing the device from a non-trusted PC. It is however, not a default option for login, and I have never been able to figure out how it decides to send SMS messages. Microsoft really needs to have this option available for those who want it.</p>
<p>We are going to step three enabling Google&#39;s two factor authentication, since so many folks have Google accounts.</p>
<p>To enable Google&#39;s two factor authentication, first, go to your Google Account and click security and find 2-step verification.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/03/setting-up-google-two-factor-authentication/032813_1351_SettingupGo1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For 2-step verification, change the settings form Off to On.</p>
<p>You will then be prompted for a phone number to use for SMS messages. The phone, along with the accompanying verification code, is the second factor of authentication, it is the thing you have. Type in the mobile phone number</p>
<p><img src="/2013/03/setting-up-google-two-factor-authentication/032813_1351_SettingupGo2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Enter in your phone number and a verification code will be sent to your mobile device. You will then be asked to verify the code</p>
<p><img src="/2013/03/setting-up-google-two-factor-authentication/032813_1351_SettingupGo3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You will then be asked if you want to trust the computer you are on. This will allow you to log in without being prompted with a code very time. This trust usually lasts 30 days.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/03/setting-up-google-two-factor-authentication/032813_1351_SettingupGo4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And then lastly, click confirm</p>
<p><img src="/2013/03/setting-up-google-two-factor-authentication/032813_1351_SettingupGo5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, each time you log into your Google account from a non trusted computer, a SMS message will be sent to your phone that will need to enter.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/03/setting-up-google-two-factor-authentication/032813_1351_SettingupGo6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, this is a bit cumbersome, I grant you. However, it is almost necessary if you are using Google services for anything remotely important to your non-digital world. Do you have bank account information in Gmail? Then turn on two factor authentication. Do you have send yourself passwords in Gmail? Then turn on two factor authentication. Do you have health information in Gmail? Then turn on two factor authentication. Do you use your Google account as your account name for anything important? Then turn on two factor authentication.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to realize. You NEED your cell phone to log into Google services now. If you do not have your cell phone with you, or you are travelling overseas without phone access, then you will not be able to log in to your account. However, Google has several options for you. First, for those on the Android platform they have an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> that will generate the authentication codes for you. Option the second is you can print out a small piece of paper that has a one time, ten digit codes that you can use to get access.</p>
<p>Second, applications that log into Google services to get access to your mail or contacts via POP or IMAP will no longer work. To work around this, Google allows you to create application specific passwords. These passwords are generated on the screen and then you never see them again. There are steps on how to do this at <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185833">http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185833</a>. For those using Outlook, Apple Mail, accessing email via phone, this will need to be done. Those of you paying attention at home will realize you are really back to a single password. While this is true, you cannot get access to your account via web browsers. Second, and more importantly, you cannot manage your account with it. You can also revoke access to anyone of these passwords at any time.</p>
<p>Last, it is good measure to, in Google, Facebook, Twitter, your Microsoft account, anything account you allow to do authorization at other locations, to review what applications you have authorized. So while you are on your account page, review the Connected applications and sites to see who you have authorized to have access, and what level of access to your Google account data.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/03/setting-up-google-two-factor-authentication/032813_1351_SettingupGo7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Personally, I have a Gmail account that I use for my &quot;public&quot; life. It is the address I sign up for things like Facebook with, the email address I use for accessing services I subscribe to, like Netflix, etc. For personal use, I also have a Google Apps domain that I use for personal email with family and friends. Google Apps also support two factor authentication.</p>
<p>As digital identity becomes more and more integrated into daily lives, it is everyone&#39;s responsibility to ensure they can be secure as possible. Take the steps now where you can, because by the time you should have taken the steps, it will be too late.</p>
