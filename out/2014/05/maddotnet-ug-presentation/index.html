    <h1>Madison .NET User Group - May 2014</h1>
    <p>Thanks to everyone who came out to my <a href="http://www.meetup.com/MADdotNET/">Madison .NET User Group</a> presentation on AngularJS on May 7th,
2014.</p>
<p>Had a really nice turnout and the group was great to give a talk to! Engaging, with lots of good questions. They even humored me when
I went on a brief Lou Reed interlude!</p>
<p>You can find a copy of my slides on my site <a href="AngularJS.pptx">here</a>.</p>
<p>The code for my demo is available on <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> at <a href="https://github.com/jptacek/MadDotNet">https://github.com/jptacek/MadDotNet</a> along with
the slides.</p>
<p>There are also several blog posts I have written about Angular, <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/tags/angularjs/">http://www.jptacek.com/tags/angularjs/</a>. Also, for those
interested in learning more about DocPad, here is a post where I talked about moving over, <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2013/12/saying-hello-to-docpad/">http://www.jptacek.com/2013/12/saying-hello-to-docpad/</a></p>
<p>As always, feel free to reach out to me via email (blog -@- jptacek.com) or on twitter, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jptacek">@jptacek</a>.</p>
<p>To those of you who attended, thanks much!</p>
