        <title>Innovation, Artificial Intelligence and the Economy</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>May you live in interesting times is an old curse. Well, we certainly are living in interesting times! Over the last 5-10 years, we have seen enormous growth in computing power driven by cloud infrastructure and mobile phones. This has resulted in tremendous economies of scale; driving down the cost of consuming and utilizing computational resources. As a result, the goals of Artificial Intelligence become realized at a much greater pace than the vast majority of people have anticipated, and it will bring changes.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://jptacek.com/2016/05/DeathOfMooresLawAndTheGameOfGo/">written</a> in the past about Google’s DeepMind and the Game of Go. It was long thought that a computer being able to beat a champion Go players was at most a decade or two away. However, this happened <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11213518/alphago-deepmind-go-match-5-result">last summer</a> with Google’s DeepMind platform.</p>
<p>Google built on the success of DeepMind and utilized it with their language translation service, <a href="https://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a>. This has resulted in order of magnitude increases in the ability to translate between languages. Google <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html?_r=0">stated</a> that the night they turned on Deep Mind for their translation platform, they saw a greater increase in fluency than they had in the previous 10 years of improving the platform. In fact, Google now <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2114748-google-translate-ai-invents-its-own-language-to-translate-with/">believes</a> their DeepMind platform has created its own, intermediary language that it uses to translate between different languages, independent of programmers telling it to. It did it on its own. This is crazy Sci-Fi stuff!</p>
<p>So what happens when Sci-Fi becomes part of the real world? Disruption, always lots of disruption. If you look at the economic impact of the Information Revolution, it is amazing. In the 1970s General Motors employed 800,000 workers around <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2008/09/a_brief_history_of_general_mot.html">the world</a>. Today, they are still the largest car manufacturer, but employ 250,000 people, a fraction of the number in the 70s. Also, their market cap has reduced greatly and they are no longer the largest company in the globe. Manufacturing companies across the world share similar stories.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this change is automation. Technology has invaded manufacturing facilities and has reduced the number of humans involved in creating physical objects. This trend is only continuing. <a href="http://www.foxconn.com/">Foxconn</a>, which manufactures iPhone for <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> and is the one of the largest electronic manufactures in the world is hard at work on factory automation. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36376966">Recently</a>, in a Foxconn facility in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunshan">Kunshan</a>, they reduced the workforce at their plant from 110,000 to 50,000 people, 60,000 workers. In fact, Foxconn is <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161229PD206.html">working</a> on automating their entire assembly line, resulting in numerous workers losing their jobs.</p>
<p>So, we can see the impact of large investment in automation and technology driving down manufacturing costs and reducing headcount. In the recent United States election, one of the big tenets of President-elect Trump’s campaign was to bring back manufacturing jobs and repeal or modify trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The issue though, those jobs have in many instances disappeared, not because of trade deals, but because of automation. Manufacturing jobs <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2017/01/economics-and-finance">peaked </a>in 1979 at 19.5 million and currently sit around 12.3 million. Apple is currently <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/11/17/report-claims-apple-iphone-assemblers-tasked-to-develop-us-manufacturing-plans">rumored</a> to be exploring manufacturing iPhones in the US with a partner like Foxconn. If those jobs though are automated, employing very few people than traditional manufacturing, have we done anything more than make ourselves feel good?</p>
<p>If we look at our current economy and take a company like Google, which battles back and forth with Apple for the largest market cap in the world, employs 60,000 people, an order of magnitude less than GM did when it was the world’s biggest company in the 70s. Further, consider a company like <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com">Whats App</a>, which FaceBook bought for 22 billion dollars <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-28/facebook-s-22-billion-whatsapp-deal-buys-10-million-in-sales">several years ago</a>. At that time, Whats App was a 55 person company. The idea of a company being worth 22 billion dollars and employing 55 people was a ludicrous proposition only two decades ago.</p>
<p>Okay, the economy is changing, manufacturing jobs are disappearing and being replaced by technology and automation. Where does Artificial Intelligence fit into this? Well, how technology replaced jobs held by blue collar workers, Artificial Intelligence has the ability to do the same to White Collar/Knowledge worker jobs.</p>
<p>If one looks at the finance industry and the massive recession that hit in the late 2000s, a lot of that was driven by computers. How so you ask!??! Many of the large trading houses have automated programs that are responsible for trading based on market conditions. The complexity involved in the housing market of the late 00s was too much for people to understand or trade. Wall Street firms hired exceedingly smart folks in Physics and Mathematics and had them develop automated trading programs. These people, called quants, created programs that in many cases replaced traders on the floor. They moved quicker, don’t let emotion get in the way and their decisions were made on data. They also created complex financial models, for example derivatives, that helped drive the Great Recession of the 00s.</p>
<p>With the quickly realized gains in AI, the cost of implementing the technology will be reduced, and the way AI disrupted Wall Street firms is going to be heading into more and more industries. It is possible, that computer programmers of the future will be replaced by AI jobs. If AI apps can build a better Go To Market program for a product brand, will organizations continue to employ numerous brand manager employees when a computer is better able to execute? Will the knowledge worker of today, who creates the program, be replaced by the AI program of tomorrow, with the role of the (much fewer) knowledge worker being setting the conditions for the AI program. It is quite possible.</p>
<p>What does our world economy look like if what happens to manufacturing jobs happens to white collar jobs? To be honest, it looks pretty scary. Obviously, just as the Information revolution created new opportunities and new job types, these will emerge in an AI world. However, the world’s largest business employed 800K people and 30 years later, the world’s largest company employs 60K workers, it is quite possible there will be a lot fewer jobs.</p>
<p>College has always been a path for the American dream and a way to get into White Collar jobs. What happens though if there just aren’t jobs for the college educated? Folks like Elon Musk have started thinking about it… One of the ideas being floated around is that we have a <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/11/06/elon-musk-universal-basic-income/">universal income</a> for each citizen. Finland just rolled out a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/finland-trials-basic-income-for-unemployed"> two year basic income tria</a>l for unemployed citizens. Switzerland also recently had a ballot initiative for a <a href="https://qz.com/699739/why-switzerlands-universal-basic-income-referendum-matters-even-though-failed/">universal income</a>, that failed by a large margin, but it has started a conversation. The income could be created by different taxation policies for large companies generating lots of wealth, without employing lots of people. Countries, especially here in the US, are a far from having this conversation. However, as the demand for good paying jobs increases, and the economy, through automation creates less demand, there are societal problems that are going to need to be addressed.</p>
<p>In the states we have just left an election cycle where President-elect Trump very successfully campaigned to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. In England, they recently voted for to leave the European Union, with one of the tenets of the Brexit campaign to bring back jobs to England. When we talk about bringing back manufacturing jobs that have not moved overseas, but disappeared, we all have a long journey in front of us. When the technological innovation that has reduced manufacturing jobs begins to happen to knowledge workers…. well, may you live in interesting times!</p>

        <title>Online Security Best Practices</title>
        <link href="https://www.jptacek.com/2017/01/OnlineSecurityBestPractices/"/>
        <updated>2017-01-05T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:www.jptacek.com,2017-01-05,/2017/01/OnlineSecurityBestPractices/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the news full of journalist, politicians, celebrities and other people having their email and phone accounts hacked, it is a constant reminder that we should be vigilant about protecting ourselves online.</p>
<p>While no one can ensure you are 100% safe from online hacking, we have a bunch of steps for you to keep yourself secure in an increasingly hostile digital world.</p>
<p><strong>Different Passwords</strong> - First and foremost, use a different password for sites you visit. When 116 million <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> was hacked in 2012, those users’ email address and passwords eventually ended up <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/another-day-another-hack-117-million-linkedin-emails-and-password">online in 2016</a>. Users who use the same password on LinkedIn as their Gmail account quickly found themselves vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>Password Pattern</strong> - I try and use a pattern for all the sites I visit that makes each sites password, pretty unique. What does this mean? I will use a base password that has both numbers and special characters, for example, Justin20!^Bieber. I will then append a set of characters for the website I am visiting. For example, the first two letters of the domain or the first two vowels of the site. So my password for Google, taking the first two vowels from google.com of oo, would be Justin20!^Bieberoo. You can develop your own password pattern, and then use it where applicable. Don’t be like me though and tell people your pattern!</p>
<p><strong>Change Your Password</strong> - If a site gets hacked and no one tells you until three years later, that is bad. You can decrease the chances of hackers changing. Every year as you kick off your New Year’s resolutions, include changing your password for sites that are important; such as mail, phone accounts and banking.</p>
<p><strong>Password Manager</strong> - There is a lot mental energy expended remembering all of these passwords, even with a pattern. A password manager is a highly recommended approach to dealing with the deluge of passwords we are confronted with.</p>
<p>In general, password managers have plugins that can be used in browser that automatically fill in username and passwords at websites. On mobile platforms, you are prompted via the app to provide a username and password.</p>
<p>Password managers will also generate unique passwords for sites that are highly randomized such as, 7?@W^(+56KsYu8. This level of complexity is hard for hackers to try and crack.</p>
<p>Popular passwords manager include <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass </a>and <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. LastPass recently allowed their free version to connect. Highly recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Update software</strong> - It doesn’t matter how complex or strong your passwords are if you are running software that has security flaws that hackers can readily take advantage of. PCs running a 5 year old version of Adobe Flash are going to be open to hackers looking for information.</p>
<p>To alleviate this run modern versions of software. This includes latest versions of Windows 10 (upgrade from Windows XP people!) and MacOs. Make sure you are using an evergreen browser, such as <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/">FireFox</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge">Microsoft’s Edge</a> browser. If you are using outdated software, be sure to upgrade.</p>
<p>Is this a real issue? In 2016 hackers used zero day vulnerabilities in <a href="http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/47197/hacking/cve-2016-4117-adobe-flash-zero.html">Flash</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/11/windows-zero-day-exploited-by-same-group-behind-dnc-hack/">Windows</a>, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3119120/security/mysql-zero-day-exploit-puts-some-servers-at-risk-of-hacking.html">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/apple-zero-days-hacking/">iOS </a>(your Apple iPhone’s operating system) and more. Quickly upgrading your software once vendors have resolved the issue is paramount to protecting yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Two Factor Authentication</strong> - An excellent way to improve your online security is use Two Factor Authentication. Two Factor authentication essentially involves two things; a thing you know (such as a password) and a thing you have (such as a phone). Software vendors like Google, MIcrosoft and Apple support two factor authentication, which essentially requires you to provide a password when you log on, and then a number generated by an authentication application on your mobile phone (or another device like a RSA token generator). You can also setup applications to say that a device is trusted (like a home PC), which requires a token to be entered once a month or so.</p>
<p>In these scenarios, even if a hacker has a password to your email, they are required to enter in a token that is running on your mobile phone. In this scenario, if a hacker knows your password and has your phone, you are already in a bit of trouble :)</p>
<p>How serious is this? During the 2016 US Thanksgiving weekend, Google was <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/187079/20161126/google-warning-users-of-government-backed-hackers-attacking-their-accounts.htm">warning prominent journalists that their accounts</a> were under phishing attacks. Their recommendation, two factor authentication. At a minimum, keep email addresses associated with banking accounts, health and brokerage accounts secure with this approach!</p>
<p><strong>Be Wary of Public WiFi</strong> - Public WiFi can be problematic for security conscientious folks. If you are sitting at a coffee shop and doing online banking, it is possible that others on the network could be reading packets on the network and reading confidential information. To bypass this, you can use VPNs when connecting to encrypt traffic or use SSL as identified below.</p>
<p><strong>HTTPS Everywhere</strong> - In examples where you are concenred about Public WiFi, or even your work or home network, you can do your best to ensure you are running HTTPS, which is the encrypted version of web page traffic. If you click on an article at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a>, people can read the content of the page. If you read an article at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">https://www.nytimes.com</a>, it becomes much more difficult for people to read the content of the page.</p>
<p>Why is this important, especially for public pages that everyone can read? Two reasons, first, if you are reading information at sites that can provide information about you, for example, <a href="http://www.webmd.com">WebMd</a> articles, you may not want people to know the contents of what you are reading (obviously, in most cases, the not encrypted URL will provide an idea of the content).</p>
<p>Second, for public pages that are not encrypted, the pages can be changed and updated to try and get information about you. For example, if someone intercepts an HTML page from google.com, they could inject a snippet of HTML that asks you to enter your email address and password to google. At that point, game over.</p>
<p>So, if you think clicking around the Internet and changing the link to HTTP sounds like a huge pain, you are 100% correct. Thankfully, most major browser vendors have plugins that will do this automatically. I recommend people use HTTPS Everywhere from the Free Software Foundation. They have plugins for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/https-everywhere-latest.xpi">FireFox</a>, <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/https-everywhere/">Opera</a>, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about why encrypting the Internet is important, read <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq">this</a>. It is becoming more and more important, so much so that Google is giving higher rankings to secure pages over non encrypted pages.</p>
<p>Protecting yourself on the Internet is becoming more and more important to our connected digital lives. Hopefully the above tips provided you some ideas you can use to increase your security in the online world.</p>

        <title>Creating an Angular 2 Application with the CLI</title>

        <id>tag:www.jptacek.com,2016-08-13,/2016/08/Angular2GettingStarted/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.angular.io">Angular</a> is a JavasScript framework from the fine folks over at
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. The focus of Angular is building applications across all platforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Angular2GettingStarted/angularLogo.svg?raw=true" width="20%" alt="Angular Logo"></p>
<p>This is the first in a series of posts on Angular where we are using Chemistry data from the periodic table
to help us understand the framework. The others posts are</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2013/10/angularjs-introduction/">Angular - Introduction</a></li>
<li>Angular - Getting Started</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting started in the world of Web Development/JavaScript has become a lot more work over the last several years. We are pretty far
removed where someone could create a web page and a JavaScript application with notepad. Libraries and frameworks such as <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>,<br><a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> and <a href="https://aurelia.io">Aurelia</a> all require things like JavaScript task managers such as <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> or
<a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> to transpile code, bundle files, minify them, etc.
If that doesn&#39;t work, you can consider <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel</a> and/or <a href="https://webpack.github.io">WebPack</a> to get you moving.</p>
<p>The decisions for getting started have become so overwhelming, people have created a term, called <a href="https://webpack.github.io">JavaScript fatigue</a>
that sums up frustration from a subset of developers. The reality is, especially for a library like React, there are just too many tools
for people. Initial project setup, whether React or Angular takes time.</p>
<p>For example, the Angular five minute quickstart <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html">guide</a> was not very quick for me.
There are over 20 NPM packages to install and users mostly just copy and paste an existing <code>package.json</code> file. The good news is that
Angular, as well as React, both recently came out with command line tools to get developers up and running quick. That is
what we will explore in this blog post.</p>
<p>In May of this year at <a href="https://www.ng-conf.org/">NG-Conf</a> the Angular team introduced the
<a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular Command Line Interfact (CLI)</a> that helped really quickstart Angular application development and
follows best practices.</p>
<p>To install the Angular CLI, type
<code>npm install -g angular-cli</code>
and wait a few minutes. Angular CLI as of this writing (August of 2016) is currently in beta under active development. One of the
current focuses is moving from Brocolli to WebPack.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Angular2GettingStarted/angularCli1.png" alt="Install Angular"></p>
<p>Once this is done, we can now use the command line to create our application. This is seriously good stuff.</p>
<p>To get started creating an application, we simply type</p>
<p><code>ng new APPLICATION_NAME</code></p>
<p>in our case, we will call our application AngularPeriodic and type</p>
<p><code>ng new AnuglarPeriodic</code></p>
<p>This will create our application structure as well as tests, setup up TypeScript and install all the requisite NPM packages.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Angular2GettingStarted/angularCli2.png" alt="Angular CLI to create application"></p>
<p>A quick look at our directory structure sees that we hae a lot there..</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Angular2GettingStarted/angularCli3.png" alt="Atom view of application"></p>
<p>A quick look at our <code>package.json</code> file indicates the NPM packages that Google prefers out of the box, along with a testing
framework based on</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs xml">{
  "name": "angular-periodic",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "angular-cli": {},
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ng serve",
    "postinstall": "typings install",
    "lint": "tslint \"src/**/*.ts\"",
    "test": "ng test",
    "pree2e": "webdriver-manager update",
    "e2e": "protractor"
  },
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@angular/common": "2.0.0-rc.4",
    "@angular/compiler": "2.0.0-rc.4",
    "@angular/core": "2.0.0-rc.4",
    "@angular/forms": "0.2.0",
    "@angular/http": "2.0.0-rc.4",
    "@angular/platform-browser": "2.0.0-rc.4",
    "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "2.0.0-rc.4",
    "@angular/router": "3.0.0-beta.2",
    "es6-shim": "0.35.1",
    "reflect-metadata": "0.1.3",
    "rxjs": "5.0.0-beta.6",
    "systemjs": "0.19.26",
    "zone.js": "0.6.12"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "angular-cli": "1.0.0-beta.10",
    "codelyzer": "0.0.20",
    "ember-cli-inject-live-reload": "1.4.0",
    "jasmine-core": "2.4.1",
    "jasmine-spec-reporter": "2.5.0",
    "karma": "0.13.22",
    "karma-chrome-launcher": "0.2.3",
    "karma-jasmine": "0.3.8",
    "protractor": "3.3.0",
    "ts-node": "0.5.5",
    "tslint": "3.11.0",
    "typescript": "1.8.10",
    "typings": "1.3.1"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not only are we able to get our structure created, we can actually run our application. This is done via the
<code>ng serve</code>
command. This takes our files, such as typescript and compiles them as well as bundling via Broccoli. Our initial application start displays
a screen that lets us, literally, know that our application is working.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Angular2GettingStarted/angularCli4.png" alt="Initial Web Page"></p>
<p>Our next step, and something the Angular CLI can handle for us, is to create a component. We will dig into this more in future posts,
but one of the big benefits of Angular 2 is more modular approach for application development. We are going to create a Periodic
Table application, so it makes sense to create a Periodic Table component. This is done by using the <code>generate</code> command for
the Angular CLI command. We type</p>
<p><code>ng generate component periodicTable</code></p>
<p>and the files and structure for our component our created. This includes a TypeScript file for our component, a specification,
HTML placeholder and CSS markup.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Angular2GettingStarted/angularCli5.png" alt="Component Generate"></p>
<p>A quick change to our initial app structure to wire up the component (again, more on this later) and we can see our component get rendered.</p>
<p>In general, the structure of our application follows current Angular best practices. All the JavaScript files are placed in
an app directory.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Angular2GettingStarted/angularCli6.png" alt="Directory Structure"></p>
<p>The component TypeScript gets generated and creates our selector, reference our HTML template as well as our
CSS file for styling.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs javascript">import { Component, OnInit } from <span class="hljs-string">'@angular/core'</span>;

@Component({
  moduleId: <span class="hljs-built_in">module</span>.id,
  selector: <span class="hljs-string">'app-periodic-table'</span>,
  templateUrl: <span class="hljs-string">'periodic-table.component.html'</span>,
  styleUrls: [<span class="hljs-string">'periodic-table.component.css'</span>]
})
export <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> PeriodicTableComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}
</code></pre>
<p>So, this is a quick look at the Angular CLI process for Angular 2. It is a great improvement over the previous setup process and helps
development teams get up and moving quicker.</p>

        <title>Angular/Angular2 Introduction</title>
        <link href="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Anuglar2Introduction/"/>
        <updated>2016-08-12T05:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:www.jptacek.com,2016-08-12,/2016/08/Anuglar2Introduction/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent a lot of time blogging about <a href="https://jptacek.com/tags/angularjs/">AngularJS</a> in the past. Time moves on, especially on the Internet and 
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> is feverishly working on finishing up <a href="https://angular.io">Angular2</a>, which is currently in release candidate as of 
this writing (August of 2016).
<img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/08/Anuglar2Introduction/angularLogo.svg?raw=true" width="25%"></p>
<p>We will take a similar approach to last time, where we developed a periodic table application that investigates different features about 
Angular.</p>
<p>One thing to note, Google has renamed Angular 2. The previous version of AngularJS, the 1.x stack was called AngularJS. The new
version is now called just Angular. Part of the reason for this is to show its ability to create native mobile applications, so 
the JavaScript name can be a bit limiting. We will, in general, keep the same names. Angular and/or Angular 2 will refer to the current 
version of Anuglar. The older versions will be called AngularJS or Angular 1.x.</p>
<p>First though, why even upgrade at all, since the upgrade path from Angular 1.x to Angular 2? Let&#39;s highlight some reasons.</p>
<h3 id="component-based">Component Based</h3>
<p>Web development is moving towards component based development, especially with some of the emerging
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-HTMLComponents">web standards</a>. While those standards are not fully completed yet, Google is definitley
preparing for that world. If you need further proof, checkout Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/">Polymer</a> project.</p>
<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>
<p>TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript created by Microsoft, open sourced and adopted by Google (I know!! Right?!?!)
TypeScript essentially is ECMAScript 6, combined with the ability to create type and annotations. It is used to create 
Angular. The code samples developed by Google are all in TypeScript, with JavaScipt following later. You don&#39;t HAVE to use 
TypeScript, but it will make life easier.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-dom">Virtual DOM</h3>
<p>One of the things <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a> taught the world, is the value of a Virtual DOM. This is a virtual representation
of the Document Object Model (DOM) for a HTML page. You can then work on this in memory which offers GREAT performance improvements. 
Google has adopted a Virtual DOM and has realized the expected performance boosts.</p>
<p>Those are a few of the highlights of why Angular2 over AngularJS 1.x. We will hit more as we contineu our series.</p>

        <title>Apple WWDC 2016 Recap</title>
        <link href="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/07/WWDC2016Recap/"/>
        <updated>2016-07-05T05:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:www.jptacek.com,2016-07-05,/2016/07/WWDC2016Recap/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the Developer world, there are usually three big conferences each year; Microsoft’s Build, Google I/O and Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC). Google’s <a href="https://events.google.com/io2016/">I/O</a> conference, its 10th, just wrapped up last week. Let us take a spin around some of the more interesting announcements from the conference. We have previously looked at 
<a href="https://jptacek.com/2016/04/Build2016Recap/">Build</a> and <a href="https://jptacek.com/2016/05/GoogleIO2016Recap/">Google I/O</a>, lets
dive into <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> which was held in June in San Francisco.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jptacek.com/2016/07/WWDC2016Recap/wwdc2016.jpg" alt="Apple WWDC 2016"> </p>
<p>Apple’s WWDC keynote this year, tended to be the more consumer facing, rather than developer facing of the other keynotes from 2016. A majority of the time was spent on items such as iOS 10 features, Apple music redesign, Apple photos, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Siri</strong> – One of the big rumors heading into WWDC was that iMessage, Apple’s very popular messaging platform would be being made available to Android devices. That wasn’t announced. However, a slew of changes are coming to iMessage. The changes mostly are “fun”; items such as stickers, new emojis, videos, bubble effects etc. Given the popularity of iMessage though, we know these features will be popular. Unlike other messaging application, for example Facebook messenger, WhatsApp, etc, the usage may be limited, since as of now, you cannot take advantage of these new features for users on other platforms like Android. Given that for most iOS users iMessage means SMS, it could lead to frustration.</p>
<p><strong>iMessage</strong> – here have been two OS releases of Apple Watch in its first year. However, it can still be frustratingly slow to use in day to day activities. Apple announced watchOS 3 which seems to greatly alleviate some of the performance issues. Applications were shown on the current version and the new version and were markedly faster. Apple Watch users will be excited for the new upgrade if those performance gains are realized as promised.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Watch</strong> – Google announced their me too competitor to Amazon’s Alexa, a voice activated search appliance for the home. You will be able to ask Google Home things like what is the weather for the day, did the Chicago Fire win last night, etc. Pricing and availability dates were not announced. Google’s introduction video.</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong> – iOS has a new round of updates as it hits version 10. The notification screen has been greatly redesigned. Apple music has been streamlined and the maps application has been improved. 3D touch, which was introduced with last year’s new iPhones (6s, 6s Plus) is also more fully integrated into the system, especially on the notification screen.</p>
<p><strong>Contextual Awareness</strong> – The interesting thing that is permeating a lot of the developer conversations as of late is contextual awareness. A platform, like Google Now, can read email, look at your calendar and contacts as well as location to provide a wealth of information. This can provide very useful and pertinent information to a user. However, the downside to this is you are giving up a some of your privacy, as the service collects your information and mines it. This has definitely been Google’s approach. Apple has a stated focus on privacy, so it is exceedingly more difficult for them to provide these kind of services, which often rely on cloud computing because the information would need to leave the phone. So contextual awareness happens within an application, like Siri, where it will be much more limited.</p>
<p>At WWDC, to make iOS more successful at providing contextual awareness, Apple introduced differential privacy. It is all a bit murky, and involves some crazy abstract mathematics, but it essentially takes information from your phone, randomizes it a bit to mask individual information, stores it and then can aggregate the information together. </p>
<p>How this actually works in the real world, remains to be seen. However, at first glance, I cannot imagine it being very successful, because the data that would be helpful to you, for example, discerning information about an upcoming flight, wouldn’t have enough other randomized data elements in the cloud for iOS to be able to find information about the flight. </p>
<p>Resultantly, Apple is using this new feature in four areas for iOS; emoji replacement in iMessage, predictive text in iMessage, search in Notes and search in Spotlight.</p>
<p>It is an interesting take at trying to be contextual and protect user privacy, I am just not sure how successful Apple will be trying to provide contextual awareness with it in their platform as they compete against happily data mining competitors such as Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>So that is a quick tour of 2016 WWDC. Not a lot of big announcements, but more of a refining. As phone platforms reach platform maturity, there will be less and less groundbreaking enhancements on the phone. A lot of the interesting things will be happening in the cloud services that drive these devices. Apple has a lot of catching up to do here.</p>
