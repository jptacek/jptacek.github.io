    <h1>Milwaukee .NET User Group Presentation - April 2014</h1>
    <p>Thanks to everyone who came out to my <a href="http://wi-ineta.org/">Milwaukee .NET User Group</a> presentation on AngularJS this week
(April 8, 2014).
There was a
nice turnout and some good interactions and questions. I even got a little stressed out and winded, with the screen being in the
front of the room and my laptop with code demos in the back! Hopefully it wasn&#39;t too distracting for those of you
in attendance.</p>
<p>You can find a copy of my slides <a href="AngularJS-Ineta.pptx">here</a>.</p>
<p>The code for my demo is available on <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> at <a href="https://github.com/jptacek/Wi-Ineta-AngularJS">https://github.com/jptacek/Wi-Ineta-AngularJS</a></p>
<p>As always, feel free to reach out to me via email or on twitter.</p>
<p>To those of you who attended, thanks much!</p>
