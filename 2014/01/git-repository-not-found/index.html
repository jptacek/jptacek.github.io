    <h1>GitHub Repository Not Found - Case Issue?</h1>
    <p>This morning, I was pushing a small update to my blog and I received an error that my GitHub repository was unable to
sync. Usually my workflow goes something like this...</p>
<ol>
<li>Commit GitHub changes via <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a></li>
<li>If that doesn&#39;t work, use the GitHub Windows/WPF client <a href="http://windows.github.com/">http://windows.github.com/</a></li>
<li>Use command line Git</li>
</ol>
<p>While I want to get better at 3, 1 is much easier and when I do 2, I am in a hurry. :)</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am not really sure what happened. My development environment worked fine yesterday when I committed
changes, but today there were issues. I THINK it may have to do with case differences between when I setup
the repository locally and how GitHub may be handling it on the backend today.</p>
<p>When I pushed my commit to the repo with the command</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git push origin master
</code></pre>
<p>The following error was returned</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository &#39;http://github.com/jptacek/JPTACEK.com.git/&#39; not found
</code></pre>
<p>You can see the message below</p>

<p>Again, no changes have been made to the repo. Similar messages appeared in the GitHub client and WebStorm. Other
repositories I had on GitHub I was able to commit and push changes to. The only thing I could think was that
the case was different on my local origin in comparison to the backend GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The fix was simple enough, reset the origin with and change the case of the URL so that it was exactly the
same as my repository on GitHub.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"> git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jptacek/JPtacek.com.git
</code></pre>
<p>After this, I was then able to commit changes without issue in all the different client apps as well as the command
line.</p>
<p>as shown in the following screen shot</p>

<p>It strikes me as pretty odd that GitHub would suddenly stop working because of a case issue between my local dev
machine, which has been working fine for many months, and the GitHub server. However, that appears to be the case in this instance.</p>
<p>Pretty much just documenting this for my future self :)</p>
