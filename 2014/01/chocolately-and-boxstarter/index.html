    <h1>Chocolately and BoxStarter</h1>
    <p>I recently received a new work computer (an <a href="http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/ASUS_ZENBOOK_UX301LA/">Asus i7</a> that
weighs 2.6 pounds, my old laptop, a Dell M6500 weighed over 8.5 lbs, it is like I am from the future now, but I digress).
One of the things that I don&#39;t like about getting a new PC is setting up the computer. I am very good about making sure
all of my files are stored in the cloud (via Skydrive and DropBox) and/or is under source control. I don&#39;t fear losing stuff, it
is the loss time in restoring my applications and environments that makes me crazy. I always forget to install a utility
I want. Or the exact moment I NEED to remote desktop is when I remember I forgot to ENABLE remote desktop.</p>
<p>However, since my last PC install, the world of Windows has changed, and its name is <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolately</a>.
Chocolatey is similar to apt-get on Linux, or the NPM package manager for <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node</a>. You can, via
the command line, automatically install all kinds of applications that are available on <a href="http://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a>.
For example, to install ReSharprer, fire up a command prompt and type</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">    cinst resharper
</code></pre>
<p>and away we go.</p>
<p>You can find out more at the <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolately</a> site. Essentially though, you can achieve all of
this goodness by staring a command prompt and pasting the following</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command &quot;iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(&#39;https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1&#39;))&quot; &amp;&amp; SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin
</code></pre>
<p>So, <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolately</a> solves problem the first, allowing for command line install of applications.
When paired with <a href="http://boxstarter.org/">Boxstarter</a> however, it figures out problem the second of installing many different
applications that require reboots, etc, when you are setting up a new PC. BoxStarter handles reboots and logins
automatically for the user. You can type one command and be on your way!</p>
<p><a href="http://boxstarter.org/">Boxstarter</a> also enables me to setup a URL that will have all of the applications that I want
installed in a single location. For example, I created a Gist file on GitHub with all of the programs I want installed
when I have a PC.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">    START http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?https://gist.github.com/jptacek/8099099/raw/f691b3433c09dcd361fca8cc6cfe637ca7521771/boxstarter
</code></pre>
<p>You can take a look at the file, but it is pretty basic.</p>
<p>I setup the Explorer options I want, for example, showing file extensions, and that provides me consistency across my
installs.</p>
<p>I then install the bevy of browsers that all web developers want at their disposal. This is followed by setups for Git,
NodeJS, Text Editor, coding utilities, etc. I even have installation for applications I use specifically at home, for
example, iTunes (I know, I vomit a little in my mouth each time I use it too).</p>
<p>Not only can you setup explorer options, but you can also setup your Windows environment! For example, I automatically
enable Remote Desktop, Setup HyperV and IIS on my development machines. I do this all from a single command and it
is awesome!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>
A couple of people have run into issues if you are not using a default browser that does not support Click Once (for example
Google Chrome). Matt Wrock identifies the workaround in the comments below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It sounds like your default browser is not click-once enabled. Using START from the command line will invoke the url in your default browser. If that browser is IE or another browser that has a click-once extension, Boxstarter should be invoked. If Firefox or Chrome (or Opera or safari or anything not IE) is your default browser and you had no extension that is &quot;click once&quot; app aware, the behavior you describe sounds normal. Chrome is my default browser but I installed an extension from
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/clickonceforchrome/">https://code.google.com/p/clickonceforchrome/</a> that will allow it to work with click once apps like Boxstarter&#39;s web launcher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to reiterate... You need to update your default browser to support click once. Links for</p>
