    <h1>MS Dev Podcast Show - December 19, 2014</h1>
    <p>I had the very cool experience of being invited to be part of the <a href="http://msdevshow.com/">MS Dev Show</a>, a Podcast focused on Microsoft Developer
Technologies hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/carlschweitzer">Carl Schweitzer</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/ytechie">Jason Young</a>. I enjoy the show when I get to a chance listen and, truth be told, Jason
was one of the inspirations for me switching my blogging engine to Docpad. That means I was pretty excited to be
invited on!</p>
<p>The Podcast mostly focused on AngularJS, but we talked a bit about some of the upcoming Visual Studio changes and
ASP.NET vNext, which is going to be really cool for Microsoft Developers. You can get a hint of what is coming on one of my
recent blog posts
<a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2014/12/creating-ASP.NET-vNext-application-on-OSX/">Running ASP.NET vNext on OS X</a>.</p>
<p>You can listen to the show at

Wished I would have sounded a bit more eloquent for everyone, but kind of sleep deprived.</p>
<p>Thanks Carl and Jason!</p>
